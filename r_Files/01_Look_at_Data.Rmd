# **Chapter 1** Look at Data
## Three categories of **badness**: elements of bad visualization
* *Aesthetic*  
  Tasteless graphs or those with non-informative decorations  

* *Substantive*  
  Misleading visualization  
  
* *Perceptual*  
  Perception affects how readers interpret graphs–line, shapes, colors  
    * Shape searching degrades much faster than color searching  
    * Human tend to associate "randomness" with even distribution but the truth is that random processes are more clumpy (Poisson vs. Matérn)  
    * *Gestalt rules*: Human infer relationships between objects in ways that goes beyond what is strictly visible.
