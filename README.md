# *Data Visualization (2019)* by Kieran Healy  
This repository contains practice files that I generated while following the
book written by Kieran Healy at Duke. It contains exercises in *R* along with 
notes taken while reading the book.

The main purpose of this repository is taking notes for myself. So the `.Rmd` files in the `r_Files` folder may be too obscure to follow without the book.
